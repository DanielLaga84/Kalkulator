# Kalkulator

This is my new work trying to make full functional calculator. 
v1.0 - was working but there was no debugging and divide was not working correct.
v1.1. added few changes : - System out was changed onto STDOUT so it works better. 
                          - Maven was set and it is working correct with calculator.
                          - Fixed bugs with divide by 0. 
                          - added new branch
                          - now it is working constant and no errors. 
                          - added system when you push in main menu other than 0,1,2,3 it is leaving program with thanks. 
                          - changed all numbers in scanners to nextLong()
 My plan is to make fully looking calculator.
